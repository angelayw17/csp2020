    <p style="text-align:center">We created a program that made objects move in a pattern in an infinite loop.
        First, we imported the Turtle and Math classes. After that, we created two empty lists for the sets
        <br>of shape objects that we were going to use, those being “left_shapes” and “right_shapes”. Then
        <br>we made lists for the shapes and colors of the objects that we used to initialize our objects. We
        <br>then added the shapes into their respective lists, colorized them, and moved them into their starting
        <br>positions, with the objects in “left_shapes”being facing the same direction and the objects in
        <br>“right_shapes” facing another direction. The shapes then moved forward and we established a 
        <br>condition for what happens after the first collision. We then set up the collision. After the 
        <br>shapes collided for the first time, they changed color and shape and moved in the opposite 
        <br>direction. We stored the original colors and shapes of the objects in variables so that we could 
        <br>revert them to their original conditions after the second collision. Because the objects followed a 
        <br>triangular path, they switched directions again and began to move toward each other after 
        <br>moving a predetermined distance after the first collision. When the objects collide for a second 
        <br>time, they go back to their original position repeat the same pattern in an infinite loop.
