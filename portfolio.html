    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/1.1.9 pic1.jpg" height="70"> <img src="images/1.1.9 pic2.jpg" height="70"> <img src="images/1.1.9 pic3.jpg" height="70"> <img src="images/1.1.9 pic4.jpg" height="70"> <img src="images/1.1.9 pic5.jpg" height="70"></p>
    <p style="text-align:center"><font face="Comic sans MS">We created a program that made objects move in a pattern in an infinite loop.
        <br>First, we imported the Turtle and Math classes. After that, we created two empty lists for the sets
        <br>of shape objects that we were going to use, those being “left_shapes” and “right_shapes”. Then
        <br>we made lists for the shapes and colors of the objects that we used to initialize our objects. We
        <br>then added the shapes into their respective lists, colorized them, and moved them into their starting
        <br>positions, with the objects in “left_shapes”being facing the same direction and the objects in
        <br>“right_shapes” facing another direction. The shapes then moved forward and we established a 
        <br>condition for what happens after the first collision. We then set up the collision. After the 
        <br>shapes collided for the first time, they changed color and shape and moved in the opposite 
        <br>direction. We stored the original colors and shapes of the objects in variables so that we could 
        <br>revert them to their original conditions after the second collision. Because the objects followed a 
        <br>triangular path, they switched directions again and began to move toward each other after 
        <br>moving a predetermined distance after the first collision. After the objects collided for a second 
        <br>time, they went back to their original position and restart original pattern for the next set of objects.</font></p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center"><font face="Comic sans MS">1.2.5. Project - Alien Rescue</font></h3>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/1.2.5 pic1.jpg" height="140"> <img src="images/1.2.5 pic2.jpg" height="140"> <img src="images/1.2.5 pic3.jpg" height="140"> </p>
    <p style="text-align:center"><font face="Comic sans MS">This was the original outline:
        <br>Game has a UFO, aliens, and rocks. There is also a timer and a score component. The UFO can move
        <br>around using keyboard controls. The score increases when you “rescue” (collide with) an alien.
        <br>Depending on which game mode (survival or infinite), colliding with a rock will either end the game or
        <br>cause your score to decrease. In infinite mode, the timer is set to 9,999 seconds and in survival mode the 
        <br>timer is about 1 minute.
        <br>
        <br>That didn't really work, so here's the greatly simplified outline:
        <br>Game has one UFO turtle, one alien turtle, and a list of shapes for the alien turtle. There is still
        <br>a timer and a score component, the UFO still moves around using keyboard controls, and the score 
        <br>still increases when you "rescue" (collide with) an alien. HOWEVER, there is only one game mode and zero
        <br>rocks (placement of rocks such that there was no overlapping between all turtles was too complicated). 
        <br>To play the game, move the UFO around and try to rescue aliens. When you "rescue" an alien, your score 
        <br>increases by 1 and another alien with a different shape appears in a different location. Keep rescuing 
        <br>aliens until the timer runs out.</font></p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center"><font face="Comic sans MS">1.3.1. Project - Cannonball</font></h3>
        <p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q59XJXnmkkBNDORAyzvd5fztWLB__TSn/view?usp=sharing" target="blank"><font face="Comic sans MS">Video of Project</font></a></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/1.3.1 pic2.jpg" height="140"> <img src="images/1.3.1 pic3.jpg" height="140"> <img src="images/1.3.1 pic4.jpg" height="140"> </p>
    <p style="text-align:center"><font face="Comic sans MS">We created the game Cannonball, in which a user controls and adjusts a cannon to shoot a
        <br>cannonball at targets moving across the screen. The targets are spawned at random heights at the right 
        <br>boundary of the game screen and move at random speeds toward the left side of the screen. When the user 
        <br>successfully hits a target, the target disappears, a new target is created, and the user's score increases. 
        <br>Regardless of whether or not the cannonball hits or misses a target, it continues on its straight path 
        <br>until it reaches the game's top or right boundary and is returned to it's original position at the cannon. 
        <br>If a target reaches the left boundary, the game is over.
        <br>We also created four game modes: easy, normal, hard, and super hard. As the game modes increase in difficulty,
        <br>the targets get smaller in size and move more quickly, and the cannonball gets smaller in size.</font></p>
